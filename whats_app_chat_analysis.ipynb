      "“The government's sudden enforcement of the lockdown seemed hastily prepared and immediately disadvantaged already vulnerable populations. There has been a mass exodus of migrant workers and concerns are rising about starvation among people who work in the informal economy. Implementing public health measures is difficult in places with overcrowded living conditions and inadequate hygiene and sanitation. Non-COVID-19 health services have been disrupted. Reports suggest that the government's efforts to provide financial support and a measure of food security to ease these pressures will be insufficient to meet demand. But better planning and communication could have helped avert this crisis.”\n",

      "ChatGPT\n",
      "(a) In light of the above passage, does the decision by the Government seem justified?\n",
      "The government's decision to enforce a sudden lockdown was justified from a public health perspective, as it aimed to curb the rapid spread of COVID-19, a virus that posed a severe threat to human life. However, the execution of the lockdown appears poorly planned and lacked foresight, particularly in addressing the needs of vulnerable populations such as migrant workers and those in the informal economy. A more balanced and well-prepared approach could have mitigated the socio-economic hardships caused by the lockdown. Thus, while the intent was justified, the implementation was not.\n",
      "\n",
      "(b) While curbing the spread of the disease on one hand and heralding mass economic crisis on the other, was it a ‘lesser wrong,’ and why?\n",
      "The lockdown can be considered a \"lesser wrong\" because the immediate priority was to save lives in the face of an unprecedented health crisis. Allowing the virus to spread unchecked could have overwhelmed the healthcare system, leading to catastrophic loss of life. However, the economic crisis triggered by the lockdown disproportionately impacted vulnerable populations, highlighting the ethical dilemma of choosing between public health and economic stability. It was a difficult trade-off, and while lives were prioritized over livelihoods, better planning and communication could have reduced the extent of economic and social suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "(c) Was the action of imposing lockdown a utilitarian decision or a deontological one? Explain.\n",
      "The decision to impose a lockdown was largely utilitarian in nature, as it sought to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people by prioritizing public health over individual freedoms and economic stability. The utilitarian framework justified the restriction of movement and economic activity to prevent the spread of the virus, thereby protecting the majority from severe health risks and potential fatalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, from a deontological perspective, the suddenness of the lockdown and its disregard for the immediate welfare of vulnerable groups violated moral obligations to protect all citizens, particularly those most in need. A deontological approach would have emphasized planning and protecting these groups regardless of the broader utilitarian outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "(d) Could there be a deontological solution for paving a way to resist the pandemic in view of the plight of the masses working in the informal economy? Validate your argument.\n",
      "A deontological solution would focus on the moral duty to protect the inherent rights and dignity of every individual, particularly the vulnerable. Such a solution could include:\n",
      "\n",
      "Advance Notice and Preparation: Announcing the lockdown with sufficient lead time to allow migrant workers to return home and informal workers to secure basic needs.\n",
      "Financial and Food Security Measures: Ensuring direct cash transfers, food distribution, and healthcare access for informal workers and daily wage earners to reduce their suffering.\n",
      "Localized Containment: Implementing localized restrictions in hotspots rather than a blanket lockdown, thus minimizing disruptions to livelihoods while curbing virus spread.\n",
      "Public Communication and Transparency: Clear communication of plans and rationale behind measures to build trust and cooperation among the public.\n",
      "These measures align with deontological ethics by respecting the rights and dignity of vulnerable populations without compromising the broader goal of pandemic resistance. Balancing these ethical obligations with public health needs could ensure a more equitable and humane response.\n",

Here's how you can implement this in Python:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Code Implementation\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def getroot(x, p, e):\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    Finds the pth root of x within an error tolerance of e.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Parameters:\n",
      "    x : float : The number whose root is to be found\n",
      "    p : int   : The root to be calculated (e.g., p=2 for square root)\n",
      "    e : float : Tolerable error\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Returns:\n",
      "    float : The pth root of x\n",
      "    \"\"\"\n",
      "    if x < 0 and p % 2 == 0:\n",
      "        raise ValueError(\"Cannot calculate even root of a negative number.\")\n",
      "    \n",
      "    # Initial guess\n",
      "    guess = x if x >= 1 else 1.0\n",
      "\n",
      "    while True:\n",
      "        # Newton-Raphson formula for pth root\n",
      "        next_guess = ((p - 1) * guess + x / (guess ** (p - 1))) / p\n",
      "        if abs(next_guess - guess) < e:\n",
      "            return next_guess\n",
      "        guess = next_guess\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Explanation:\n",
      "1. **Input Parameters:**\n",
      "   - `x`: The number for which the \\(p\\)th root is calculated.\n",
      "   - `p`: The degree of the root (e.g., \\(p = 2\\) for square root, \\(p = 3\\) for cube root).\n",
      "   - `e`: Tolerable error, determining the accuracy of the result.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Algorithm:**\n",
      "   - Use the **Newton-Raphson formula** to iteratively refine the estimate for the root.\n",
      "   - Stop when the difference between consecutive guesses is less than \\(e\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Handling Edge Cases:**\n",
      "   - \\(x < 0\\): If \\(x\\) is negative and \\(p\\) is even, raise an error since the result would not be real.\n",
      "   - Small values of \\(x\\): Ensure convergence with an appropriate initial guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Usage\n",
      "```python\n",
      "print(getroot(27, 3, 0.0001))  # Cube root of 27\n",
      "print(getroot(16, 4, 0.0001))  # Fourth root of 16\n",
      "print(getroot(0.001, 3, 0.0001))  # Cube root of 0.001\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This function is efficient and handles arbitrary roots and errors with precision.\n",

      "involving one of our students, Sayani Sen, a first-year M.Tech student in VLSI. It is with great sorrow \n",
      "that we inform you of her suicide today, 10/02/2025, but the shocking part of this incident is the \n",
      "complete negligence and gross inefficiency exhibited by the authorities and staff responsible for the \n",
      "safety and well-being of the students.\n",
      "Sayani went missing for an extended period of time, and despite her mother searching for her across \n",
      "the campus for almost two hours, there was no assistance from the security personnel or any \n",
      "university staff to help locate her. It is highly distressing to think that no one in the university took \n",
      "any responsibility for ensuring the safety of the student during this time. Ultimately she was found \n",
      "at around 7 PM at very terrible condition at the back of academic building near the generator and \n",
      "her pulse was still going on.\n",
      "Further compounding this tragedy was the complete failure of the university's emergency services. \n",
      "The university ambulance, which is supposed to be available 24 hours, was not readily accessible to \n",
      "the students. This, despite the fact that Sayani was still alive and we, the students of MAKAUT tried \n",
      "to get access for public transport which took almost 20 minutes. The students, then managed to \n",
      "arrange for a toto rickshaw, but by the time they reached the hospital, it was too late, the girl passed \n",
      "away.\n",
      "Additionally, the problem regarding the ambulance was also complained earlier but no action has \n",
      "been taken.\n",
      "This incident raises serious concerns about the overall management and security systems of the \n",
      "university. It is not enough to blame just the security personnel and drivers. This is a systemic failure\n",
      "that reflects poorly on the administration and the management's lack of responsibility in ensuring \n",
      "student safety. The lack of communication, coordination, and proper management of emergency \n",
      "resources is appalling. This cannot be brushed aside as a one-time error. The higher authorities, \n",
      "including relevant administrative personnel, are all accountable for this horrific chain of events. `\n",
      "The students also asked the security to call the Higher Authorities multiple times but they directly \n",
      "denied and after that we took some actions to draw their attention to this matter.\n",
      "We strongly urge you, as the Vice Chancellor, to investigate this matter thoroughly and take \n",
      "appropriate action against all those responsible. This tragedy should not be reduced to just another \n",
      "news report. It is imperative that all systems related to student safety and emergency services are \n",
      "urgently reviewed and improved. The university must ensure the prompt and efficient response to \n",
      "emergencies and must guarantee that such a senseless loss of life never occurs again.\n",
      "We expect nothing short of a full investigation and accountability from the university’s management. \n",
      "The failure to act appropriately in this case is unacceptable, and we demand immediate attention to \n",
      "this matter.\n",
      "Yours sincerely,\n",
